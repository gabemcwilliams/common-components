# common-components

A collection of reusable Python components for data workflows, auth flows, plotting, and secure ML development.  
Built for use in notebooks, APIs, and production support scripts.

Maintained by Gabe McWilliams under Darkly Creative LLC.

## Overview

This repository serves as a modular toolbox for Python-based development, including:

- Secure authentication helpers (e.g., Vault, MSAL)
- Diagnostic and environment checks
- Data plotting utilities for reporting or notebooks
- Workflow and infrastructure helpers for ML/data engineering projects

All components are intended to be self-contained, reusable, and easily integrated into larger projects.
